CppUnit 
--------

1. Write unit test as .cpp and add proper CppUnit includes:
///
#ifndef <FILENAME>_H
#define	<FILENAME>_H

#include <cppunit/extensions/HelperMacros.h>
#include "</Path/File to be tested>.cpp"
///

2. Add line to makefile
///
<FILENAME>.o: <FILENAME>.cpp
	gcc -c <FILENAME>.cpp -I${CPPUNIT_PATH}/include
///

and add <FILENAME>.o to first and second lines of "runtests:" at the top

3. Run "make; ./runtests" to run the tests
